Module documentation:

NAME
    Sub::Name - (re)name a sub

SYNOPSIS
        use Sub::Name;

        subname $name, $subref;

        $subref = subname foo => sub { ... };

DESCRIPTION
    This module has two functions to assign a new name to a sub -- in
    particular an anonymous sub -- which is displayed in tracebacks and
    such. Both functions are exported by default.

  subname NAME, CODEREF
    Assigns a new name to referenced sub. If package specification is
    omitted in the name, then the current package is used. The return value
    is the sub.

    The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc). You
    won't be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name. To allow
    that, you need to do glob-assignment yourself.

    Note that for closures (anonymous subs that reference lexicals outside
    the sub itself) you can name each instance of the closure differently,
    which can be very useful for debugging.
